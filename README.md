<br/>

Clippy for PySide2. 
This provides a generic Clippy Widget, with animations, that can be used in any PySide2 application.

The project was inspired by and originally forked from <a href="https://github.com/LoganKelly/ClippyForMaya">ClippyForMaya</a> 
by Ryan Bland, Logan Kelly, and Nick Hurm, although None of the original code remains, and it was rewritten 
loosely based on <a href="https://github.com/clippyjs/clippy.js">ClippyJS</a>. 


The code is provided as is, and has not been rigorously tested in a production environment.
